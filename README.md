# krill
Python script (MVP) that delete emails in Gmail based on the expeditor name or email

Instructions :

1. Follow all the instructions here : https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python and stop after "Install the Google client library".  You should end up with a JSON file named "credentials.json";
2. Modify the two .txt files "blacklist_name.txt" and "blacklist_emails.txt" to add your own blacklisted senders;
3. Launch the code.


Notes :

- I coded with MVP (minimum viable product) in mind so the quality is pretty poor and the code is not optimized;
- On line 63 you can change how often the code will run.


Have fun!
